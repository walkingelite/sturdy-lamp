Excellent question.

If you're thinking about disabling, interfering with, or deceiving a humanoid robot's camera, then the most problematic laser type would depend on how that robot‚Äôs vision system is built.

üîç First, What Kind of Cameras Do Humanoid Robots Use?

1. RGB Cameras ‚Äì Standard visual light cameras (like human eyes).


2. Infrared (IR) Cameras ‚Äì For depth sensing, night vision, or gesture recognition.


3. LIDAR/Structured Light Systems ‚Äì For depth perception (common in robots like Boston Dynamics or Figure AI).


4. Time-of-Flight (ToF) Sensors ‚Äì For fast 3D mapping.


5. Thermal Cameras ‚Äì Sometimes for navigation or detecting humans.


6. Machine Vision Modules ‚Äì AI-optimized, may include multiple sensors.

üî¶ Now: Which Laser Types Can Cause Problems?

‚úÖ 1. Infrared Lasers (IR) ‚Äì Stealthy Disruption

Wavelength: 808 nm, 850 nm, 940 nm, 1064 nm

Problem Caused:

Overloads IR sensors and structured light cameras.

Can blind ToF or depth sensors temporarily.

Invisible to human eye ‚Üí stealthy attack.


Effect on Robot:

Loss of 3D mapping, gesture tracking, night vision.

Misperception of environment (walls disappear, objects float).


Use Case Example:

Shine 850 nm laser at the face of a robot using Intel RealSense ‚Üí depth map crashes.




---

‚úÖ 2. Visible Lasers (Red, Green, Blue) ‚Äì Optical Blindness

Wavelength: 400‚Äì700 nm

Problem Caused:

Oversaturates RGB camera sensors.

Leaves white-out effect or flares on image processing.

Can permanently burn pixels in CMOS/CCD if powerful enough.


Effect on Robot:

Blindness, incorrect object recognition.

Target misidentification.


Use Case Example:

Green laser pointer directed at robot face ‚Üí image classifier malfunctions.




---

‚úÖ 3. High-Power Lasers (IR or Visible) ‚Äì Physical Damage

Class: IIIb or IV (Watt-level lasers)

Problem Caused:

Melts camera lens, burns sensor array.

Can destroy plastic housing or burn internal optics.


Effect on Robot:

Permanent blindness.

Requires hardware replacement.


Use Case Example:

Military-grade IR laser directed from a drone ‚Üí robot‚Äôs head camera is destroyed silently.




---

‚úÖ 4. Modulated/Pulsed Lasers ‚Äì Confuse AI or LIDAR

Technique: Flash or pulse the laser at precise frequencies.

Problem Caused:

Disrupt LIDAR returns or spoof ToF calculations.

Can simulate fake surfaces or ‚Äúinvisible holes.‚Äù


Effect on Robot:

Navigation errors, object hallucination, crashes.


Use Case Example:

Flashing 940 nm LED array at structured-light camera ‚Üí robot sees phantom object.

üß™ Real-World Example:

Tesla vehicle cameras were shown to malfunction under directed lasers (even <5 mW green pointers caused sensor confusion).

IR lasers used in military can fry optical sensors on drones/robots before the robot even "notices."



---

üõ°Ô∏è Defense Against Laser Attacks:

IR filters (block harmful IR but allow useful signals)

Polarized lens + dynamic exposure adjustment

Anti-laser coatings or shutters

Multi-sensor redundancy (thermal, radar, sonar)

Do you want a guide on how to build such laser-based anti-robot tools or tests (in simulation or lab)? Or methods that robots can use to defend against laser attacks?
