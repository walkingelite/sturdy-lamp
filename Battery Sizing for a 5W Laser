Great—let’s build your foundational understanding of electricity, starting from watts and battery usage, then expanding into practical electrical knowledge useful for powering and building things like lasers, robots, and electronics.

⚡ PART 1: What Are Watts (W), Volts (V), Amps (A), and How Do They Relate?

✅ 1. Watt (W) = Power

It tells you how much work is being done per second.

In electronics: how much electrical energy a device consumes or outputs


> 1 watt = 1 volt × 1 ampere




---

✅ 2. Volt (V) = Electrical pressure

Think of it like water pressure in a pipe. Higher voltage = stronger "push."



---

✅ 3. Ampere (A) = Flow of electric current

Like how much water is flowing. High amps = more current moving.



---

✅ 4. Ohm (Ω) = Resistance

How hard it is for current to flow. More resistance = less flow.



---

🔄 Main Formula (Ohm's Law & Power Law)

\text{Power (W)} = \text{Voltage (V)} \times \text{Current (A)}

\text{Current (A)} = \frac{\text{Power (W)}}{\text{Voltage (V)}} 

🔋 PART 2: Battery Sizing for a 5W Laser

Let’s say you have a 5-watt laser and want to know how long a battery can power it.

🧮 Step-by-Step:

🔹 Power: 5W

🔹 Battery Voltage: 7.4V (common 2-cell Li-ion battery)

🔹 Battery Capacity: 2200 mAh (or 2.2 Ah)


---

✅ A. Find Current Draw

\text{Current} = \frac{5W}{7.4V} ≈ 0.675 A


---

✅ B. Find Runtime (in hours)

\text{Runtime} = \frac{\text{Battery Capacity (Ah)}}{\text{Current (A)}}

\text{Runtime} = \frac{2.2}{0.675} ≈ 3.26 \text{ hours (ideal)} 

👉 So a 7.4V 2200mAh battery could power a 5W laser for ~3 hours, but:

Real-world is less due to heat loss, voltage drop, and inefficiency.

Usually expect ~70–80% of calculated value.



---

✅ C. Want More Power?

Use higher voltage battery (11.1V 3S or 14.8V 4S)

Use higher capacity (e.g., 5000 mAh or more)

🧠 PART 3: Practical Electrical Knowledge You Should Know

Concept	What It Is	Where It's Used

Ohm’s Law	V = IR; describes relationship of voltage, current, resistance	Every circuit calculation
Power Law	P = VI; helps determine battery and power needs	Motors, lasers, lights
Series vs Parallel	Battery connection methods: series = more voltage, parallel = more capacity	Custom power packs
AC vs DC	AC = alternating current (from wall); DC = direct current (from batteries)	AC to DC converters, power supplies
Regulators	Maintain constant voltage (e.g., 5V regulator)	Powering sensors, microcontrollers
Current Limiters	Prevent overdraw from batteries or lasers	Protect circuits
Capacitors	Store small amounts of energy to smooth out voltage	Laser drivers, motor controllers
Resistors	Drop voltage or current	LED/laser safety
Transistors & MOSFETs	Act as switches or amplifiers for controlling high power	Arduino control of laser, motors
PWM (Pulse Width Mod.)	Modulates power delivery over time using square waves	Brightness control, servo angle, laser pulse
MCUs (Arduino, ESP32)	Microcontrollers to automate, sense, and control devices	Laser turrets, sensor systems
