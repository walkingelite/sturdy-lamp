Excellent—now we’re entering real-world laser system design. Let’s calculate:


---

🔢 SCENARIO:

You want a laser device (2W or 5W) that works at:

20 meters

50 meters

100 meters


You asked:

1. How much battery capacity do I need?


2. How long will it last?


3. How big/heavy would the battery be compared to a human?

⚡ STEP 1: Basic Laser Power Requirements

Laser Power	Voltage (Typical)	Current (Amps)

2W	7.4V	2W ÷ 7.4V ≈ 0.27 A
5W	7.4V	5W ÷ 7.4V ≈ 0.68 A


We'll assume a Li-ion battery at 7.4V, which is two 3.7V cells in series (2S).


---

⚙️ STEP 2: Runtime vs. Battery Size

We'll calculate battery size needed for 30 minutes, 1 hour, and 2 hours of operation.

🔋 Battery Capacity Formula:

\text{Battery Capacity (Ah)} = \text{Current (A)} \times \text{Time (hours)}


---

🧮 For 2W Laser:

Run Time	Current Needed	Battery Size (Ah)	Battery Size (mAh)

30 min	0.27 A	0.135 Ah	135 mAh
1 hour	0.27 A	0.27 Ah	270 mAh
2 hours	0.27 A	0.54 Ah	540 mAh


✅ Even a small 18650 Li-ion cell (2200 mAh) could power a 2W laser for 4+ hours.


---

🧮 For 5W Laser:

Run Time	Current Needed	Battery Size (Ah)	Battery Size (mAh)

30 min	0.68 A	0.34 Ah	340 mAh
1 hour	0.68 A	0.68 Ah	680 mAh
2 hours	0.68 A	1.36 Ah	1360 mAh


✅ A single 18650 cell (2200 mAh) can power a 5W laser for about 3 hours.


---

📦 STEP 3: Battery Size Compared to Human

Battery Type	Capacity	Size	Weight

18650 cell	2200–3500 mAh	~18×65 mm	~45–50 g
2S Pack	7.4V 2200 mAh	2×18650	~100 g
4S Pack	14.8V 5000 mAh	~palm-sized	~400 g
Laptop Battery	~50 Wh	Book-sized	~500–600 g
Car Battery	~600 Wh	Backpack	~10–15 kg



---

✅ So, for a 5W laser working 1 hour:

Distance	Power Needed	Battery Needed	Battery Size vs Human

20 m	5W	680 mAh @ 7.4V	Fits in your palm
50 m	Still 5W	680–1000 mAh (add margin)	Like 2 fingers stacked
100 m	Add optics/aiming	Maybe 5W–10W, ~1.5–2 Ah	~Size of soda can (200–300g)


Even for 100 meters, you don’t need a big battery—optics become more important than raw power.

🛠️ Real-World Tips:

🔭 To Reach Farther (not more power, just smarter):

Use tight-focus lenses (collimation optics)

Mount laser on pan-tilt aiming system

Reduce beam divergence: get beam diameter <2 mm



---

📦 Summary Table:

Laser Power	Range	Runtime	Battery Size	Weight Estimate

2W	20–50 m	1 hour	270–500 mAh (1×18650)	~45 g
5W	20–100 m	1 hour	680–1500 mAh (2×18650 or 1 small LiPo)	100–250 g
10W	100+ m	1 hour	~2–4 Ah	~300–500 g (softball-sized)
